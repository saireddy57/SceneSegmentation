# Scene Segmentation with UNET Using Knowledge Distillation

This project implements a UNET-based semantic segmentation model for road scene segmentation. We utilized knowledge distillation to enhance the training process by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher model (Resnet34 backbone) to a smaller student model (Resnet18 backbone). The objective was to maintain high accuracy while reducing the model size for efficient deployment.

## Model Architecture:

Teacher Model: UNET with Resnet34 backbone
Student Model: UNET with Resnet18 backbone
Knowledge Distillation: Online distillation, where both models are trained simultaneously and the student model learns from the teacherâ€™s feature maps and predictions.

## Dataset:
This dataset provides data images and labeled semantic segmentations captured via CARLA self-driving car simulator. The data was generated as part of the Lyft Udacity Challenge . This dataset can be used to train ML algorithms to identify semantic segmentation of cars, roads etc in an image.

## Knowledge Distillation Approach:
We applied online knowledge distillation, where both the teacher and student models are trained in parallel. The student model receives two types of guidance:

Distillation Loss: Leveraging the softer output of the teacher model to guide the student, helping it learn intermediate features that improve its generalization.

## Training Results:

Train Loss: 0.157

Train IOU: 0.650

Validation Loss: 0.210

Validation IOU: 0.623

The model achieves a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, with the student model reaching a **Train IOU of 0.650 and a Validation IOU of 0.623**.

Future Improvements:
Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve generalization.
Experimenting with other teacher-student combinations or backbone architectures.
Exploring post-processing techniques to enhance segmentation accuracy.
